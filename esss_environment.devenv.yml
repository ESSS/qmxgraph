# PhantomJS
# pros:
# * doesn't open a browser (i.e. known as headless)
# * as consequence, doesn't interfere with developer GUI
# * uses Webkit, same web browser engine used by Qt
#
# cons:
# * seems slower than Firefox driver
# * harder to debug (can't put a breakpoint and take a look at web driver's
#   browser, for instance)
#
# Firefox
# pros:
# * easier to debug (Firefox [and Chrome] already come with developer tools
#   builtin nowadays)
#
# cons:
# * pops up a Firefox instance for each test
# * it is not the same web browser engine as used by Qt
#
# Tip: Use `--driver <driver_name>` to change driver for a single run
  PYTEST_ADDOPTS: --driver PhantomJS
