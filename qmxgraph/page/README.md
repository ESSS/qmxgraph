Images and stylesheets
======================

Some default images and stylesheets provided to customize graphs. 

The image `arrow.png` can be configured as image shown where users can 
click to start a new edge connection between 2 vertices. It is free, no 
link necessary and comes from [IconFinder](https://www.iconfinder.com/icons/211624/arrow_c_up_icon#size=128).
 
The image `grid.gif` is the tile image used for grid in background of
graph, to help with snapping cells. It is also free, created by this 
project.

The stylesheet `graph.css` is not from mxGraph, but internal to this
project. It can be replaced to customize the style used by DIV container
of graph drawing widget.
