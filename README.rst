This a Qt widget that embeds a rich and powerful graph drawing tool 
using JavaScript's mxGraph library. 

It makes use of Qt web view features to make this possible. Since
current Qt version supported is still using [WebKit](https://webkit.org/)
as its web browser engine, all of its limitations apply when developing
new embedded web features.
