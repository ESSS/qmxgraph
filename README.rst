This a Qt widget that embeds a rich and powerful graph drawing tool 
using JavaScript's mxGraph library. 

It makes use of Qt web view features to make this possible. Since
current Qt version supported (<= 5.6) is still using WebKit_ as its web
browser engine, all of its limitations apply when developing new embedded web
features.
